## Current Approach

We're following a **Creative Exploration** approach (LOOP + TOOKIG methodologies):

1. **No migrations** - Build everything fresh from scratch
2. **Customer-first** - Validate with customers before building
3. **Navigate uncertainty** - Comfortable pivoting based on feedback
4. **Build-measure-learn** - Test on small scale continuously

See [01-EXPLORATION/HACKATHON_PLAN.md](./01-EXPLORATION/HACKATHON_PLAN.md) for the complete process.

## Getting Started

### For New Contributors

1. **Read the Vision**: [00-VISION/PLATFORM_VISION.md](./00-VISION/PLATFORM_VISION.md)
2. **Understand the Approach**: [01-EXPLORATION/HACKATHON_PLAN.md](./01-EXPLORATION/HACKATHON_PLAN.md)
3. **Check Active Work**: [01-EXPLORATION/](./01-EXPLORATION/) for current exploration
4. **Reference Design Docs**: [02-DESIGN/](./02-DESIGN/) for technical patterns

### For Feature Development

1. Start with [Customer Discovery](./01-EXPLORATION/CUSTOMERS/)
2. Generate ideas in [Brainstorming Sessions](./01-EXPLORATION/IDEAS/)
3. Create prototypes in [PROTOTYPES/](./01-EXPLORATION/PROTOTYPES/)
4. Validate with customers in [VALIDATION/](./01-EXPLORATION/VALIDATION/)
5. Write specs in [FEATURES/](./01-EXPLORATION/FEATURES/) when validated

---

## Key Principles

1. **Customer Value First** (LOOP) - Always validate with customers
2. **Navigate Uncertainty** (TOOKIG) - Comfortable with ambiguity and pivoting
3. **Build Fresh** - No legacy code dependencies
4. **Measure Everything** - Quantify value and success
5. **Iterate Fast** - Small-scale testing, quick feedback loops

# Archive: Migration Approach

This directory contains the original migration/integration approach documentation.

## Contents

- **[INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md](./INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md)** - Original phased migration plan

## Why Archived?

We've shifted from a migration approach (merging UXDB into VibeOps) to a creative exploration approach (building new features from scratch, inspired by ideas but not constrained by existing code).

## When to Reference

You might want to reference these docs if:
- Understanding the original migration strategy
- Seeing what was considered but not pursued
- Understanding technical constraints that were identified
- Learning from the analysis that was done

## Current Approach

The current active approach is documented in [01-EXPLORATION/](../01-EXPLORATION/) - creative exploration with LOOP and TOOKIG methodologies, building everything fresh.

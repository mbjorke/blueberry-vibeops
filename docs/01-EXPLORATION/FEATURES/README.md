# Feature Specifications

Complete feature specifications ready to build (Session 6).

## Structure

Each feature is a complete spec:
- **Concept**: What is this?
- **Why**: Why does it matter? (customer problem)
- **Customer Segment**: Who is this for?
- **Quantified Value**: Measurable value (hours saved, % improvement)
- **User Story**: Who uses it and how?
- **Data Requirements**: What data do we need?
- **UI/UX Approach**: How does it look/feel?
- **Technical Approach**: How do we build it?
- **Success Metrics**: How do we know it works?

## Requirements

Only features that have:
- ✅ Passed customer validation
- ✅ Quantified customer value
- ✅ Clear technical approach
- ✅ Success metrics defined

## Next Steps

Once a feature spec is complete, it's ready for implementation. Build from scratch, no legacy code dependencies.

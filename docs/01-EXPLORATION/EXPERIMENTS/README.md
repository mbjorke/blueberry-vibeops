# Data Experiments

Experiments exploring what insights are possible with current ops data (Session 4).

## Structure

Each experiment is a markdown file:
- **Hypothesis**: What we're testing
- **Data Analysis**: What we found
- **Results**: Patterns and insights
- **Ideas**: Features we could build with this data

## Purpose

Before building features, we explore:
- What data do we have?
- What patterns exist?
- What insights are possible?
- What can we build with this?

## Examples

- Tool usage patterns
- Security correlations
- Deployment success factors
- Tool effectiveness metrics

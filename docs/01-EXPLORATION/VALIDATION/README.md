# Customer Validation

Customer validation results and pivot decisions (Session 5 - LOOP + TOOKIG).

## Contents

- **validation-results.md** - Customer feedback, validation outcomes
- Individual validation notes for each prototype tested

## Purpose

Before building, we validate with customers:
- Show prototypes to real users
- Get feedback on value and usability
- Measure if customers see the value we estimated
- Decide: Proceed, Pivot, or Abandon

## LOOP Alignment

- Interact with target groups
- Change direction based on feedback (pivot)
- Test on small scale

## TOOKIG Alignment

- Navigate uncertainty by adapting based on new information
- Comfortable with pivoting when feedback changes direction
- No rigid plans that can't adapt

## Pivot Decisions

For each prototype:
- **Proceed**: Customer validated, build it
- **Pivot**: Change direction based on feedback
- **Abandon**: Doesn't solve real customer problem

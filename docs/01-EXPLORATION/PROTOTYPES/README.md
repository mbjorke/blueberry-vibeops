# Rapid Prototypes

Quick visual and technical sketches of top ideas (Session 3).

## Structure

Each prototype gets its own folder:
```
[feature-name]/
├── mockups/          # UI mockups, sketches
├── flows/            # User flow diagrams
├── technical.md      # Technical notes, data requirements
└── notes.md          # Build complexity, blockers, questions
```

## Purpose

Before building, we create quick prototypes to:
- Visualize the idea
- Check technical feasibility
- Identify data requirements
- Estimate complexity
- Prepare for customer validation

## Next Steps

After prototyping, prototypes move to [VALIDATION/](../VALIDATION/) for customer testing.

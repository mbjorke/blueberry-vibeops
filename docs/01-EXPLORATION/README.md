# Creative Exploration (LOOP + TOOKIG Aligned)

This directory contains all active creative exploration work following LOOP (customer value focus) and TOOKIG (navigating uncertainty) methodologies.

## Quick Start

1. **Read**: [HACKATHON_PLAN.md](./HACKATHON_PLAN.md) - The creative exploration process
2. **Start with**: [CUSTOMERS/](./CUSTOMERS/) - Customer discovery (Session 0)
3. **Then**: [IDEAS/](./IDEAS/) - Brainstorming and concept exploration
4. **Prototype**: [PROTOTYPES/](./PROTOTYPES/) - Rapid visual/technical sketches
5. **Validate**: [VALIDATION/](./VALIDATION/) - Customer validation results
6. **Build**: [FEATURES/](./FEATURES/) - Ready-to-build feature specs

## Directory Structure

- **[HACKATHON_PLAN.md](./HACKATHON_PLAN.md)** - Complete creative exploration process
- **[CUSTOMERS/](./CUSTOMERS/)** - Customer research, segments, insights
- **[IDEAS/](./IDEAS/)** - Brainstorming outputs, concept mashups, evaluation framework
- **[PROTOTYPES/](./PROTOTYPES/)** - Rapid prototypes and sketches
- **[EXPERIMENTS/](./EXPERIMENTS/)** - Data experiments and findings
- **[VALIDATION/](./VALIDATION/)** - Customer validation results and pivot decisions
- **[FEATURES/](./FEATURES/)** - Complete feature specifications ready to build

## Philosophy

**No migrations, no legacy code dependencies.** Every new feature is built fresh, inspired by ideas but not constrained by existing implementations. We validate with customers before building, and we're comfortable pivoting when needed.

## Current Status

This is active work. New ideas, prototypes, and validated features will appear here as the creative exploration progresses.
